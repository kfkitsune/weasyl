  <h2>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Dashboard</h2>
  <p>
    2FA provides an additional layer of protection for your account by requiring
    your password--which is <em>something you know</em>--and additionally a time-based
    token, which is <em>something you have</em>.

    <h4>Recovery Code Status</h4>
    <p>
      You currently have ${tfa_recovery_codes_count} valid recovery code(s) assigned to your account.
      We advise not relying on recovery codes as a routine access method, and further advise to never
      use the last two codes; a minimum of two codes are required to disable 2FA from a logged-out state.
